### Description:

Activity recognition involves identifying physical activities (like walking, running, sitting) based on data from sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. In this project, we use the popular UCI HAR dataset to train a machine learning classifier (e.g., Random Forest or LSTM) to recognize activities from time-series sensor data.

- Recognizes human physical activity using time-series sensor data
- Uses a Random Forest classifier on engineered features from accelerometers and gyroscopes
- Evaluates performance with confusion matrix and classification report
