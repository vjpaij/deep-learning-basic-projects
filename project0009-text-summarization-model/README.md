### Description:

Text summarization is the task of condensing a long document or paragraph into a shorter version while preserving key information. In this project, we use a pre-trained transformer model like T5 or BART from Hugging Face to perform abstractive summarization, where the model generates new text as the summary.

- Performs abstractive text summarization using T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
- Converts long text into concise summaries
- Shows how pre-trained models can be directly applied to real-world data
